# Ascii Separators!

If you check out [ASCII codes](https://www.asciitable.com/) 28-31, you'll see that they are data separators.
I changed the name of `group` to `table`, `record` to `row` and `unit` to `field` so I can keep a mental model
of a database.  

This is just a little repo to test out playing with them. I plan on it being unit tested, and have functions to
save the data to a file, load files back up and print it legibly somehow.
